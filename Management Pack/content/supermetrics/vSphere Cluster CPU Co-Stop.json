A simple average is used instead of normalized average that consider the size of the VM (number of vCPU). \n\nIt is using 20 second average instead of 5 minute average, to give leading indicator. \n\nFor details, see VCF Operations Transformation book and vSphere Metrics book, which are parts of Operationalize Your World.",
